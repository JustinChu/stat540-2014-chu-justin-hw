Final project feedback
========================================================

Disclaimer: this is a quick processing of high-level themes from the student and instructor evaluations of the projects. It's more than a transcription, but not much. But I think it's better than nothing!

From all angles, this project was in the lower half but definitely above others. The relative weakness of the digital supplement was perhaps a missed opportunity?

Good presentation.

The biology was explained clearly.

Could have explored more statistical methods / make use of contrast in linear model to better address the question.

I wish their tables reported marginal totals.

Several figures seem naive / not worth the real estate, eg heatmap of first 100 probes before and after imputation.

Feels rather rote. Spelling problems, eg principal vs principle

Some important details about the analysis are missing, eg which coeff are you evaluating?

Figures are of low quality, small fonts, small points

Missing: no ??? about the source

Text too small

No citation for KOBAS

Double counting genes in enrichment analysis

What's the reference sample? Where are samples from?

Classifier overfit

Specification of model unclear

Too much text but didn't give me a chance to read it

Never explained the title or what the question is

Good job saying unexpected results -- did not find difference between the two diseases

More work can go into plots (very small font, took a screenshot of an RStudio table)

great to see all lecture material incorporated into analysis -- looking at poster looked like a review of the course

DE analysis was very clearly explained and described on the poster

classifiers should have been assessed using more than just error rate (sens, spec, ROC)

it is unclear how a classifier would be useful for treatment or research

gene enrichment analysis was not explained or interpreted

clear statement of problem, good choice of dataset, wide range of appropriate methods chosen

poster presentation a bit cluttered, some acronyms (NC, LDA) not defined anywhere

not completely simple to see why particular methods were chosen

over all good acknowledgment of the limitations of the data set

impressive follow up with the GO analysis

unclear whether 1283 were probe hits or gene hits

biological question was clear and story easy to follow

motivation for some statistical methods was lacking. how does PCA and clustering support your story?

alot of the figures lacked y axis labels. and some figures were too small.

hierarchical clustering was performed pre-normalization?

should have assessed their classifiers using more than just the error rate

the 3D PCA plots are hard to read

sample KNN distance plot is confusing. needs legend and y axis label

good discussion of sex vs age vs expression

objective, steps, and conclusions very clear

some formatting standards are neglected

the design matrix is not clear, where is the effect of Age?

how was limma used to account for Age? no formula

probe and gene are used interchangeably which is not good

Digital supplement:

TA: The IBD digital supplement is sufficient, but lacks integration between components. Yiming Zhang's PCA and clustering report is particularly good.

JB: The `README.md` provides fairly perfunctory explanation of main components and who's doing what. But I'm left to wander around the R and Rmd code on my own. To their credit, files and directories have reasonably self-documenting names. I didn't see explicit figure writing commands, nor is there a directory of, say, figures used for the poster. So I have some suspicions that there was some manual work that could/should have been done in a more automated fashion and better documented.
